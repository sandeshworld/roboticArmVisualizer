# roboticArmVisualizer
Python GUI application to create custom linkages and adjust joint angles. In the future, I plan to add 2d inverse kinematics solver so it can be used for planning too. Ultimately, I would also take it to 3d kinematics, though I would like to do that with WebGL and JavaScript on a browser. If you find this interesting and would like to work with me to add features, please reach out to me.

Built for fun & independently to apply things I am learning in a Robotic Manipulations Course. 
While trying to visualize the linkages working within angular constraints for assignments,
I had a hard time finding a tool to create a view movement of custom linkages, so I built this tool
to allow user to create custom links (length, min & max angles, initial angle) and to modify the angle
for each point.
