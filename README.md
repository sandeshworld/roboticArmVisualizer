Built for fun & independently to apply things I am learning in a Robotic Manipulations Course 
While trying to visualize the linkages working within angular constraints for assignments,
I had a hard time finding a tool to create a view movement of custom linkages, so I built this tool
to allow user to create custom links (length, min & max angles, initial angle) and to modify the angle
for each point.
