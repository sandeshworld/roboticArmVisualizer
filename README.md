# roboticArmVisualizer
Python GUI application to create custom linkages and adjust joint angles. In the future, I plan to add 2d inverse kinematics solver so it can be used for planning too. If you find this interesting and would like to work with me to add interesting features, please reach out to me.

Built for fun & independently to apply things I am learning in a Robotic Manipulations Course. 
While trying to visualize the linkages working within angular constraints for assignments,
I had a hard time finding a tool to create a view movement of custom linkages, so I built this tool
to allow user to create custom links (length, min & max angles, initial angle) and to modify the angle
for each point.
